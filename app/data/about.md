#### Intro

I have 15+ years of theoretical modeling, coding, numerical simulation, and data analysis experience. Being trained as a theoretical physicist, my solid skills in coding and numerical simulations include Python, MATLAB/Mathematic, and Fortran programming. My favorite math skills are calculus, linear algebra, and group theory.  Most of my scientific findings were presented in over 30 peer-reviewed journal [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uOK_OjMAAAAJ&hl=en).


<br/>
In addition, I mentored a research group up to 4 members and collaborated effectively with other teams. I am proud of myself for taking the initiative to propose the novel idea, implement the process, conducting numerical computations, analyzing the results, and presenting our findings to high impact journals.

<br/>
I strongly believe that nowadays many real-life issues can be properly modeled with the fast-developing big data and machine learning techniques.  In recent years,  I have gained some hands-on experience in cutting-edge skills in data visualization, data analysis, machine learning, and web development. 


<br/>
I am passionate in learning and sharing.

<br/>

<details> 
   <summary> Before college</summary>
   <ul>
   <li>
I grew up in a village of Zhejiang province, 300 km south to Shanghai, China. Before age 10, our village has no stable electricity service. We mostly use kerosene lamps at night. Yet there were lots of fun in the quiet, slow village life. We raise pigs, chickens, cats, dogs, cattle,  etc. We play water, climb mountains, grow vegetables, grow fruits, catch fish, fly kites, and play kid's gambling games. We also have much opportunity to learn from older generations the stories about malicious spirits, fictitious underwater animals, etc. I became a Chinese chess and Ping-pong lover. I completed education from elementary to high school in my hometown. Then I went to various universities in cities for further learning and work.</li>
 <li>At age 12 I learned and soon became indulged in <b>playing ping-pong</b>, for which I won my first championship in my high school at age 15.</li>
<li> At age 14, <b>physics</b> became my favorite subject and I became the top student at my high school. At age 17, I graduated from high school(ranked #2) and became a physics major at a university.</li>
<li>During the age of 11-17, I developed a hobby, i.e., <b>reading martial arts novels</b>. Those beautiful adult fairy tales(especially those written by contemporary authors Yong Jin and Long Gu) were the sweetest memories of my teenage periods.</li> 
<!-- and played a lasting influence in forming my moral and aesthetic trend.</li> -->
</ul>
</details>

<details> <summary> BS years</summary>
<ul>
 <li>At age 20(1995), I learned <b>quantum mechanics</b> and fascinated by it ever since. It imposed a deep, lasting influence on how I understand the world. At about the same time, I learned the issue of time arrow from the point of view of statistical physics, as well as the intriguing Godel's theorem in mathematical logic. These three topics remain attractive and appealing to me even today.</li>
<li>
 In 1996, I passed the postgraduate entrance examination and became the a master canditate in theoretical physics. The title of my BS thesis was "on classical coding and quantum coding".</li>
 </ul>
</details>

<details> <summary> MS years</summary>
<ul>
<li>During 1996 to 1998, I learned to do numerical simulations for lattice spin models with the <b>Monte Carlo algorithm</b> and so called density matrix renormalization groups(DMRG) algorithms. I excelled in learning advanced quantum mechanics and group theory. I won the ping-pong championship in graduate school in our university.</li>
<li>In 1999, I independently wrote a paper "Some notions about broken-symmetry", in which I presented a personal understanding on  the relation between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Since then, statistics become one of my most favorite topic.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details> <summary> Ph.D. years</summary>
<ul>
<li>From 1999 to 2000, I learned Lie group and Lie algebra and <b>made a prediction</b> on SO(5) theory proposed by Shoucheng Zhang(an outstanding Professor from Stanford University) for high Tc superconductors.</li>
<li>In 2000, I became deeply interested in <b>Buddhism</b>. Together with some friends from the philosophical department, we organized many seminars and activities at Fudan University. </li>
<li>In 2002, I got my Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Fudan University(Top 5 in China). During the years, I published 4 papers in the areas of high Tc superconductivity and magnetic systems. I did a lot <b>MATLAB and Fortran numerical simulations</b> in those projects.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details> <summary> Postdoc Research</summary>
<ul>
<li>I worked as a postdoc researcher in the Center of Advanced Study at Tsinghua University((Top 2 in China)) from 2002 to 2004. In 2003, three of us proposed a mean-field theory for the strongly correlated model for high Tc superconductivity on the triangular lattice. We obtained a complete phase diagram after three months of hard work on every detail of theory, including a large ammount of numerical simulations to <b>optimize several sets of different parameters</b> for the conjectured solution.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details> <summary> Faculty years</summary>
<ul>
<li>In 2004, I got a faculty position at the Zhejiang Normal University, began my teaching career on several physics courses, and started my research career as an independent principal investigator and the leader of an academic team.</li>
<li>In 2005, I independently <b>developed a new approach</b> (the core of this approach is to rigorously transform an infinite set of linear equations into a finite set of linear equations) for quantum transport calculation on general lattice models. This kind of approach was adopted years later by the authors of Python package Kwant, which now became one of the most popular packages to do quantum transport simulations.</li>
<li>In 2005-2007, we applied the newly developed method to <b>quantum transport calculations</b> related to the topic of spin hall effect and published three papers in the internationally well recognized Journal ---Physical Review B. Among these works, we <b>proposed a new model</b>, i.e., lateral spin-orbit coupling model, which inspired some  experimental development in later years.</li>  
<!-- Formulated a scattering wave function approach to study the quantum transport phenomena in an arbitrary lattice model for mesoscopic systems. Such a method is algorithmically more efficient than the traditional Green’s function approach.  In this approach, the boundary conditions connect the quantum wave functions of different parts which lead to coupled linear equations. The central numerical task is to solve the sets of coupled linear equations. With such an approach, the symmetry properties of the transport process can be better understood. Based on this approach, we successfully performed a series of transport studies for different systems -->
<!-- I found a way to solve the set of linear equations with an infinite number equations and get the scattering wave function in an arbitrary lattice model for mesoscopic systems. Such a method is algorithmically more efficient than the traditional Green’s function approach.  The central numerical task in this approach is to solve a set of coupled linear equations with a finite number of unknowns. Based on this approach, we successfully performed a series of transport studies for different systems.
Linear algebra is the main math tool used in linear regression and neural networks and my techniques/experience in solving the linear equations are transferable to linear regression, neural networks, and other related algorithms. -->
<li>In 2005, we systematically analyzed a basic problem in theoretical physics, i.e., the transformation of the phase(as well as other related quantities) with respect to the coordinate frame, for classical and quantum equations, and discussed some implications of this analysis on quantum mechanics.</li>
<li>In 2007, I visited Purdue University for 4 months. Together with the hosting professor, we worked out a mean-field theory of superconductivity in graphene and obtained some neat results, which later become widely known to the field. This work was published in May of 2008 and was reported in a review published in Review of Modern Physics(the most famous review Journal of physics) in Oct 2008.</li>
<li>
<details> <summary>Religious Conversion</summary>
<ol>
<li>In 2007, during the 4 months of my visit at Purdue, I <b>studied bible and gospel</b> from a Lutheran missionary and became interested in Christian worldview. </li>
<!-- I started to find harmony between Buddhism and Christianity and gradually accepted the fact that there was a deep difference between them. -->
<li>In 2009, I was <b>converted from Buddhism to Christian</b> after nearly two years of questioning and speculations. </li>
</ol>
</detail>
</li>
<li>In 2010, by adding a thermal effect into the quantum transport theory, I <b>solved an intriguing problem</b> raised by an experimental group at Purdue University which was a puzzle to them for more than half an year. This year, I was promoted as a professor in physics department at Zhejiang Normal University. </li>
<li>In 2011,  I <b>found a rigorous proof</b> for the connectivity property of surface/edge states of 3D/2D topological insulators. The robust surface states is a good example of <b>"dimensional reduction"</b> phenomena in the context of solid-state physics. The method I developed in this paper was adopted by an internationally prestigious group in their work on other fancy models. </li>
<li>In 2011, I collaborated with some international collaborators on suspended graphene and we proposed a new scheme to realize an electron pump in which electric curret can be generated by ac gate volgate.</li>
<li>In 2012, through <b>identifying a hidden symmetry</b> in the model for suspended graphene,  we proposed a new way to generate so called pure valley current in graphene. We further proposed a way to measure such exotic current experimentally. This work was published in the top physics journal Physical Review Letters. It played a continual academic impact on the field and was a highlight in my career as theoretical physicist.</li>
