#### Intro

I have over 15+ years of computational model development and data simulation, data analysis experience. Being trained as a theoretical physicist, my solid skills in numerical simulations include Python, MATLAB/Mathematic, and Fortran programming, as well as data analysis by mathematical and statistical modelling. Most of my scientific findings were presented in over 30 peer-reviewed journal publications.

<br/>

In addition, I mentored a research group up to 4 members and collaborated effectively with other teams. I am proud of myself for taking the initiative to propose the novel idea, implement the process, conducting numerical computations, analyzing the results, and presenting our findings to high impact journals.

<br/>

With many physical, mathematical, and statistical models in mind, I tend to understand the complicated real world in a computational way. I believe that most real-life issues can be properly modeled with our rational intuition powered by the fast-developing machine learning and statistical methods.

#### Some history
I grew up in a village of Zhejiang province, east coast of China. Before age 10, our village has no stable electricity service. We mostly use kerosene lamps at night. However, we had lots of fun. The kids around our age at that area play similar small gambling games. Each game can be our favorite hobby for several years. Later I became a fan of Chinese chess. Due to the slow pace of village life, we also have much opportunity to learn from older generations the stories about malicious spirits, fake underwater animals, etc. Here are some important memories of my history.



- At age 12 I learned and soon became indulged in playing ping-pong, for which I won my first championship in my high school at age 15.

- At age 15, physics became my favorite subject and I became one of the top students at my high school. At age 17, I graduated from high school(scored #2) and became a physics major at Ningbo University.

- During the age of 11-17, I developed another hobby, i.e., reading martial arts novels. Those beautiful adult fairy tales(especially those written by contemporary authors Yong Jin and Long Gu) were the sweetest memories of my teenage periods and played a lasting influence in forming my moral and aesthetic trend.

- At age 20(1995), I learned quantum mechanics and fascinated by it ever since. It imposed a deep, lasting influence on how I understand the world. At about the same time, I learned the difficult issue of time arrow from the point of view of statistical physics, as well as the intriguing Godel's theorem on mathematical logic. All of these three topics are most interesting to me in the coming decades.

- In 1996, I passed the postgraduate entrance examination and became the first graduate of Ningbo University that entered a master's program in physics. The title of my BS thesis was "on classical coding and quantum coding".

- In 1997, I extended my MS supervisor's research on a mean-field theory for the quantum transversal Ising model with spin half and spin one case to the general spin case. Meanwhile, I learned to program in Fortran. Also, I learned to do numerical simulations based on the Monte Carlo algorithm as well as density matrix renormalization groups(DMRG) algorithms. I ranked #1 in the physics class on advanced quantum mechanics and group theory. I won the ping-pong championship in graduate school at Suzhou University.

- In 1999, I independently wrote a paper "Some notions about broken-symmetry", proposing a unified way to understand the relation between thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and mean-field theories. In June of 1999, I got my MS degree in theoretical physics from Suzhou University and entered Fudan University to continue my academic career in physics.

- From 1999 to 2000, I systematically learned continuous group theory and made a new prediction on SO(5) theory proposed by Shoucheng Zhang for high Tc superconductors.

- In 2000, I became deeply interested in Buddhism. Together with some friends from philosophical department, we organized many seminars and activities in Fudan University.

- In 2002, I got my Ph.D in theoretical physics from Fudan University(Top 5 in China). During the years, I published 4 papers in the areas of high Tc superconductivity and magnetic systems. I did a lot MATLAB and Fortran numerical simulations in these projects.

- In 2003, three of us(the leader is Tao Li, an outstanding expert on the strongly correlated physics in China) proposed a mean-field theory for the strongly correlated model for high Tc superconductivity on the triangular lattice. I obtained a complete phase diagram after three months of hard work on every detail of theory, including a large number of numerical simulations to optimize several sets of different parameters for the projected solution.

- In 2004, I got a faculty position at the Zhejiang Normal University, began my teaching career on several physics courses, and started my research career as an independent principal investigator.

- In 2005, I independently developed a scattering wave function approach on general lattice models to quantum transport calculation. The derivation of the core formula and the benchmark calculation was done in less than two weeks. This kind of approach was adopted years later by the authors of Python package Kwant, which now became one of the most popular packages to do quantum transport simulations.

- In 2005-2007, I applied the newly developed method to quantum transport calculations related to the topic of spin hall effect and published three papers in the internationally well recognized Journal ---Physical Review B. I was the first person in our university to publish papers in Physical Review series.

- In 2005, I systematically analyzed a basic problem in theoretical physics, i.e., the transformation of the phase(as well as other quantities) with respect to coordinate frame, for classical and quantum equations, and discussed some implications of this analysis on quantum mechanics.

- In 2007, I visited Purdue University for 4 months. My collaborator Prof. JiangPing Hu urged me to work out a mean-field theory of superconductivity in graphene. After two weeks of intensive work, I completed most of the analytical and numerical work. We obtained some neat results, which later become widely known to the field. This work was published in May of 2008 and received much attention in the field. The world-leading physicist, Carlo Beenakker at Leiden University, introduced our work in his Colloquium published in Review of Modern Physics in Oct 2008.

- In 2007, during the 4 months of my visit at Purdue, I learned Gospel from a Luthran missionary. I started to find harmony between Buddhism and Christianity and gradually accepted the fact that there was a deep difference between them.

- In 2009, I was baptized to become a Christian after one and a half years' period of questioning, thinking during which most of my doubts were resolved.

- In 2010, by adding a thermal equilibrium effect into the quantum transport theory, I solved a puzzling question raised by an experimental group at Purdue University. 

- In 2011, accidentally, I found a rigorous proof for the connectivity property of surface/edge states of 3D/2D topological insulators. The robust surface states is a good example of "dimensional reduction" phenomena in the context of solid-state physics. The method I developed in this paper was adopted by an internationally prestigious group in their work on other fancy models.

- In 2011, I worked with some international collaborators and we proposed a new pumping scheme to generate valley current in graphene.

- In 2012, I found a natural extension of our work into its general form, in which the valley current generated becomes pure. We even proposed a way to measure such pure valley current experimentally. This work was published in the top physics journal Physical Review Letters. It played continual academic impact on the field and was the most important scientific contribution in my career as theoretical physicist.

- In 2013, I wrote a short note to report a simple result, "Standard form of the scattering matrix for time-reversal symmetric system". I was very excited to receive an email from Prof. Carlo Beenakker (a true academic hero of mine) in which he expressed interest in my result and provided some feedback. Later he even cited our findings in his paper!

- During 2014-2017, I worked with Prof. Tony Low at the University of Minnesota. We proposed a model to describe the black phosphorous thin film and made several predictions on its optical properties. Our work was widely and continually cited(over 500 citations now) by researchers all over the world. From 2015, Python became one of the key coding languages of mine. And I learned to work with several most popular computational tools like vasp, wannier90, etc, for physicists working in material calculations.

- In 2017, I visited Prof. Yi Li at the University of John Hopkins. Using Mathematica, I neatly rederived the core theories of a work on unconventional superconductivity of Weyl metals, which was co-authored by the Nobel Laureate Duncan Haldane. Furthermore, I calculated some disorder effects for a one-dimensional toy model.

- In 2017, I visited Taiwan(at National Sun Yat-Sen University) for three months. I love Taiwan! I like the people and the food. I love the authentic Chinese traditions, cultural openness, and the freedom of air there. Most importantly, I even found the disconnected family of my grandfather's brother who left hometown 70 years ago!! 

- In 2018, I visited Ningbo Institute of Industrial Technology for 4 months. During those months, I efficiently commanded and utilized some group-theoretical techniques to build effective models with only a few tunable parameters that can capture the most important data structure of the information datasets for band structure obtained by detailed, first principle computations using thousand of wave components. In addition, working with Python package Kwant, I obtained the Hofstadter butterfly of twisted graphene bilayer, the star material that emerged in the physics world in 2018.

- In June of 2018, I decided to get training in data science(data visualization, data engineering, data analysis, and machine learning) and pursue a data scientist career. 





<!--
- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.

- In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.

- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.

- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.

- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.

- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.

- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.

- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have tangentially worked on two more.

- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.

- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires 3.

- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)">Muggle Quidditch</a>. We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association) including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook.

- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.

- At 20, I coauthored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team through the end of undergrad. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
