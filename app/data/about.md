#### Intro

I have 15+ years of theoretical modeling, numerical simulation, and data analysis experience. Being trained as a theoretical physicist, my solid skills in coding and numerical simulations include Python, MATLAB/Mathematic, and Fortran programming. My data analysis skills are entangled with and deeply benefited from physical,  mathematical and statistical modeling skills. Most of my scientific findings were presented in over 30 peer-reviewed journal publications.


<br/>
In addition, I mentored a research group up to 4 members and collaborated effectively with other teams. I am proud of myself for taking the initiative to propose the novel idea, implement the process, conducting numerical computations, analyzing the results, and presenting our findings to high impact journals.

<br/>
I believe that many real-life issues can be properly modeled with our rational intuition powered by the fast-developing big data and machine learning skills, as well as the exciting development in quantum computing.  In recent years,  I have been learning and gaining hands-on experience in cutting-edge skills in data wrangling, data visualization, and machine learning. Now I am looking for job opportunities as a data analyst, data engineer,  machine learning engineer, or web developer.

<br/>

<details> 
   <summary> Before college</summary>
   <ul>
   <li>
I grew up in a village of Zhejiang province, 300 km south to Shanghai, China. Before age 10, our village has no stable electricity service. We mostly use kerosene lamps at night. Yet there were lots of fun in the quiet, slow village life. We raise many animals such as cattle, pigs, chickens, cats, dogs, etc. We play water, climb mountains, grow vegetables, grow fruits, catch fish, fly kites, and play kid's gambling games. We also have much opportunity to learn from older generations the stories about malicious spirits, fictitious underwater animals, etc. I became a Chinese chess and Ping-pong lover. I completed education from elementary to high school in my hometown. Then I went to various universities in cities for further learning and then work.</li>
 <li>At age 12 I learned and soon became indulged in <b>playing ping-pong</b>, for which I won my first championship in my high school at age 15.</li>
<li> At age 14, <b>physics</b> became my favorite subject and I became the top student at my high school. At age 17, I graduated from high school(ranked #2) and became a physics major at Ningbo University.</li>
<li>During the age of 11-17, I developed a hobby, i.e., <b>reading martial arts novels</b>. Those beautiful adult fairy tales(especially those written by contemporary authors Yong Jin and Long Gu) were the sweetest memories of my teenage periods.</li> 
<!-- and played a lasting influence in forming my moral and aesthetic trend.</li> -->
</ul>
</details>

<details> <summary> BS years</summary>
<ul>
 <li>At age 20(1995), I learned <b>quantum mechanics</b> and fascinated by it ever since. It imposed a deep, lasting influence on how I understand the world. At about the same time, I learned the issue of time arrow from the point of view of statistical physics, as well as the intriguing Godel's theorem on mathematical logic. All of these three topics are most interesting to me in the coming decades.</li>
<li>
 In 1996, I passed the postgraduate entrance examination and became the first graduate of Ningbo University that entered a master's program in physics. The title of my BS thesis was "on classical coding and quantum coding".</li>
 </ul>
</details>

<details> <summary> MS years</summary>
<ul>
<li>In 1997, I <b>figured out a method</b> to extend the finite cluster mean-field theories for the quantum transversal Ising model with spin half and spin one case to the general spin case and successfully finished the benchmark calculations. Meanwhile, I learned to program in Fortran. Also, I learned to do numerical simulations based on the <b>Monte Carlo algorithm</b> as well as density matrix renormalization groups(DMRG) algorithms. I excelled in learning advanced quantum mechanics and group theory. I won the ping-pong championship in graduate school at Suzhou University.</li>
<li>In 1999, I independently wrote a paper "Some notions about broken-symmetry", proposing a unified way to understand the relation between thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and mean-field theories. This paper was highly regarded by some senior professors. In June of 1999, I got my MS degree in theoretical physics from Suzhou University and entered Fudan University to continue my academic career in physics.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details> <summary> Ph.D. years</summary>
<ul>
<li>From 1999 to 2000, I systematically learned Lie group and Lie algebra and <b>made a prediction</b> on SO(5) theory proposed by Shoucheng Zhang(an outstanding Professor from Stanford University) for high Tc superconductors.</li>
<li>In 2000, I became deeply interested in <b>Buddhism</b>. Together with some friends from the philosophical department, we organized many seminars and activities at Fudan University. </li>
<li>In 2002, I got my Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Fudan University(Top 5 in China). During the years, I published 4 papers in the areas of high Tc superconductivity and magnetic systems. I did a lot <b>MATLAB and Fortran numerical simulations</b> in those projects.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details> <summary> Postdoc Research</summary>
<ul>
<li>I worked as a postdoc researcher in the Center of Advanced Study at Tsinghua University(Beijing) from 2002 to 2004. In 2003, three of us(the leader is Tao Li, an outstanding expert on the strongly correlated physics) proposed a mean-field theory for the strongly correlated model for high Tc superconductivity on the triangular lattice. I obtained a complete phase diagram after three months of hard work on every detail of theory, including a large number of numerical simulations to <b>optimize several sets of different parameters</b> for the conjectured solution.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details> <summary> Faculty years</summary>
<ul>
<li>In 2004, I got a faculty position at the Zhejiang Normal University, began my teaching career on several physics courses, and started my research career as an independent principal investigator and the leader of an academic team.</li>
<li>In 2005, I independently <b>developed a new approach</b> for quantum transport calculation on general lattice models. The derivation of the core formula and the benchmark calculation was done in less than two weeks. This kind of approach was adopted years later by the authors of Python package Kwant, which now became one of the most popular packages to do quantum transport simulations.</li>
<li>In 2005-2007, we applied the newly developed method to <b>quantum transport calculations</b> related to the topic of spin hall effect and published three papers in the internationally well recognized Journal ---Physical Review B. I was the first person in our university to publish papers in Physical Review series. Among these works, we <b>proposed a new model</b>, i.e., lateral spin-orbit coupling model, which influenced some future experimental development.</li>  
<!-- Formulated a scattering wave function approach to study the quantum transport phenomena in an arbitrary lattice model for mesoscopic systems. Such a method is algorithmically more efficient than the traditional Green’s function approach.  In this approach, the boundary conditions connect the quantum wave functions of different parts which lead to coupled linear equations. The central numerical task is to solve the sets of coupled linear equations. With such an approach, the symmetry properties of the transport process can be better understood. Based on this approach, we successfully performed a series of transport studies for different systems -->
<!-- I found a way to solve the set of linear equations with an infinite number equations and get the scattering wave function in an arbitrary lattice model for mesoscopic systems. Such a method is algorithmically more efficient than the traditional Green’s function approach.  The central numerical task in this approach is to solve a set of coupled linear equations with a finite number of unknowns. Based on this approach, we successfully performed a series of transport studies for different systems.
Linear algebra is the main math tool used in linear regression and neural networks and my techniques/experience in solving the linear equations are transferable to linear regression, neural networks, and other related algorithms. -->
<li>In 2005, we systematically analyzed a basic problem in theoretical physics, i.e., the transformation of the phase(as well as other related quantities) with respect to the coordinate frame, for classical and quantum equations, and discussed some implications of this analysis on quantum mechanics.</li>
<li>In 2007, I visited Purdue University for 4 months. My collaborator Prof. JiangPing Hu proposed an urgent project, i.e., to work out a mean-field theory of superconductivity in graphene. After two weeks of intensive work, I completed most of the <b>analytical and numerical work</b>. We obtained some neat results, which later become widely known to the field. This work was published in May of 2008. The world-leading physicist, Carlo Beenakker at Leiden University, reported our work in his Colloquium published in Review of Modern Physics in Oct 2008.</li>
<li>
<details> <summary>Religious Conversion</summary>
<ol>
<li>In 2007, during the 4 months of my visit at Purdue, I <b>learned Gospel</b> from a Lutheran missionary. </li>
<!-- I started to find harmony between Buddhism and Christianity and gradually accepted the fact that there was a deep difference between them. -->
<li>In 2009, I was <b>converted from Buddhism to Christian</b> after nearly two years of questioning and speculations.</li>
</ol>
</detail>
</li>
<li>In 2010, by adding a thermal equilibrium effect into the quantum transport theory, I <b>solved an intriguing problem</b> raised by an experimental group at Purdue University which was a puzzle to them for half a year. This year, I was promoted as a professor in physics department. </li>
<li>In 2011,  I <b>found a rigorous proof</b> for the connectivity property of surface/edge states of 3D/2D topological insulators. The robust surface states is a good example of <b>"dimensional reduction"</b> phenomena in the context of solid-state physics. The method I developed in this paper was adopted by an internationally prestigious group in their work on other fancy models. </li>
<li>In 2011, I worked with some international collaborators and we proposed a new pumping scheme to generate valley current in graphene.</li>
<li>In 2012, I <b>identified a hidden symmetry</b> in the model for suspended graphene through which,  as an extension of our 2011 work,  we proved that the valley current can be pure in general. We even proposed a way to measure such pure valley current experimentally. This work was published in the top physics journal Physical Review Letters. It played a continual academic impact on the field and was <b>the most important scientific contribution</b> in my career as theoretical physicist.</li>
<li>In 2013, we wrote a short note to report a simple result, "Standard form of the scattering matrix for time-reversal symmetric system". I was very excited to receive an email from Prof. Carlo Beenakker (a great academic hero of mine) in which he expressed interest in our result and provided some feedback. Later he even cited our findings in his paper!</li>
</ul>
</details> 
<details> <summary> Visting Scholar</summary>
<ul>
<li>
During 2014-2017, I worked with Prof. Tony Low at the University of Minnesota. We <b>proposed a model</b> to describe the black phosphorous thin film and made several predictions on its optical properties. Our work was widely and continually cited(over 500 citations now) by researchers all over the world. From 2015, <b>Python</b> became one of the key coding languages of mine. And I learned to work with several most popular computational tools like vasp, wannier90, etc, for physicists working in material calculations.</li>
<li>In 2017, I visited Prof. Yi Li at the University of John Hopkins. Using <b>Mathematica</b>, I neatly rederived the core formula in a recent work on unconventional superconductivity of Weyl metals, co-authored by the 2016 Nobel Laureate Duncan Haldane. Furthermore, I calculated some disorder effects for a one-dimensional toy model.</li>
<li>In 2017, I visited Taiwan(at National Sun Yat-Sen University) for three months. I love Taiwan! I like the people and the food. I love the authentic Chinese traditions, cultural openness, and the freedom of air there. Most importantly, I even <b>found the disconnected family</b> of my grandfather's brother who left hometown 70 years ago!! On the academic side, I analyzed a Weyl model
and explored its spin transport properties through <b>Python numerical simulation and symmetry analysis</b>.</li> 
<li>In 2018, I visited Ningbo Institute of Industrial Technology for 4 months. During those months, I efficiently commanded and utilized some group-theoretical techniques to <b>build effective models with only a few tunable parameters that can capture the most important data structure</b> of the dataset for band structures obtained by detailed, first principle computations using thousands of wave components. In addition, working with <b>Python package Kwant</b>, I obtained the Hofstadter butterfly of twisted graphene bilayer, the star material that emerged in the physics world in 2018.</li>

<!--
- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.

- In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.

- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.

- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.

- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.

- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.

- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.

- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have tangentially worked on two more.

- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.

- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires 3.

- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)">Muggle Quidditch</a>. We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association) including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook.

- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.

- At 20, I coauthored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team through the end of undergrad. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
